The war happened because of several\\ndifferent events that took place in the years building up to 1914.\\nThe new international expansionist policy of Germany:\\n In 1890 the new\\nemperor of Germany, Wilhelm II, began an international policy that sought to turn\\nhis country into a world power. Germany was seen as a threat by the other powers\\nand destabilized the international situation.\\nMutual Defense Alliances:\\n Countries throughout Europe made mutual defence\\nagreements. These treaties meant that if one country was attacked, allied countries\\nwere bound to defend them.\\nThe \\nTriple Alliance-1882\\n linking Germany with Austria-Hungary and Italy.\\nThe \\nTriple Entente,\\n which was made up of Britain, France, and Russia,\\nconcluded by 1907.\\nThus, there were two rival groups in Europe.\\n1/6\\nFig: Alliances at the beginning of the War\\nImperialism:\\n Before World War I, Africa and parts of Asia were points of\\ncontention among the European countries because of their raw materials. The\\nincreasing competition and desire for greater empires led to an increase in the\\nconfrontation that helped push the world into World War I.\\nMilitarism:\\n As the world entered the 20th century, an arms race had begun. By\\n1914, Germany had the greatest increase in military buildup. Great Britain and\\nGermany both greatly increased their navies in this time period. This increase in\\nmilitarism helped push the countries involved into war.\\nNationalism:\\n Much of the origin of the war was based on the desire of the Slavic\\npeoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina to no longer be part of Austria Hungary but\\ninstead be part of Serbia. In this way, nationalism led to the War.\\n2/6\\nAssassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand:\\n In June 1914, Archduke Franz\\nFerdinand, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, was shot while he was visiting\\nSarajevo in Bosnia. He was killed by a Serbian person, who thought that Serbia\\nshould control Bosnia instead of Austria. Because its leader had been shot, Austria-\\nHungary declared war on Serbia. As a result:\\nRussia got involved as it had an alliance with Serbia.\\nGermany then declared war on Russia because Germany had an alliance with\\nAustria-Hungary.\\nBritain declared war on Germany because of its invasion of neutral Belgium -\\nBritain had agreements to protect both Belgium and France.\\nSome of the major battles during the war included the First Battle of the Marne,\\nBattle of the Somme, Battle of Tannenberg, Battle of Gallipoli, and the Battle of\\nVerdun.\\nPhases of the War\\nThe conflict developed on several fronts in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The two main\\nscenarios were the \\nWestern front,\\n where the Germans confronted Britain, France\\nand, after 1917, the Americans. The second front was the \\nEastern front\\n in which the\\nRussians fought against Germans and Austro-Hungarians.\\nAfter a brief German advance in 1914, the western front was stabilized and a long and\\nbrutal trench warfare started: it was a \\n\"war of attrition\"\\n (the western front\\nremained immovable). Meanwhile on the Eastern Front the Germans advanced but\\nnot decisively.\\nIn \\n1917,\\n two events changed the course of the war: the \\nUnited States joined\\n the\\nAllies and Russia, after the \\nRussian revolution,\\n abandoned the conflict and signed\\na separate peace.\\nFinally after the German offensive in the spring of 1918, the Allied counterattack\\nmanaged to force a decisive retreat of the German army. The defeat of its Germany’s\\nallies and the revolution in Germany that dethroned Wilhem II (German Emperor),\\nbrought about the signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918. The Great War was\\nover.\\nConsequences of the war\\nEconomic consequences:\\n World War I cost the participating countries a lot of\\nmoney. Germany and Great Britain spent about 60% of the money their economy\\nproduced. Countries had to raise taxes and borrow money from their citizens. They\\nalso printed money in order to buy weapons and other things they needed for war.\\nThis led to \\ninflation after the war.\\n3/6\\nPolitical Consequences:\\n World War I brought an end to four monarchies: Czar\\nNicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, Emperor Charles of Austria and\\nthe sultan of the Ottoman Empire had to step down.\\nNew countries were created out of old empires. Austria- Hungary was carved\\nup into a number of independent states.\\nRussia and Germany gave land to Poland. Countries in the Middle East were\\nput under the control of Great Britain and France.\\nWhat was left of Ottoman Empire became Turkey.\\nSocial Consequences:\\n World war changed society completely. Birth rates declined\\nbecause millions of young men died (eight million died, millions wounded, maimed,\\nwidows and orphans). Civilians lost their land and fled to other countries.\\nThe role of women also changed. They played a major part in replacing men in\\nfactories and offices. Many countries gave women more rights after the war had\\nended, including the right to vote.\\nThe upper classes lost their leading role in society. Young middle and lower\\nclass men and women demanded a say in forming their country after the war.\\n4/6\\nTreaty of Versailles:\\n On June 28, 1919, World War I officially ended with the\\nsigning of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles was an attempt to prevent\\nthe world from going into another war.\\nTreaty of Versailles\\nIt is organized in several chapters each having different clauses.\\nTerritorial clauses:\\nFrance regained Alsace and Lorraine\\nEupen and Malmedy passed into the hands of Belgium\\nEastern territories were annexed by Poland which caused East Prussia to become\\nterritorially isolated.\\nDanzig and Memel, former Baltic German cities were declared free cities\\nDenmark annexed northern Schleswig-Holstein\\nGermany lost all of its colonies and the victors annexed them\\nMilitary clauses:\\nDrastic limitation of the German navy.\\nDramatic reduction of the Army (only 100,000 troops, prohibition of having tanks,\\naircraft and heavy artillery).\\nDemilitarization of the Rhineland region.\\nWar Reparations:\\nThe treaty declared Germany and its allies responsible for all \\'loss and damage\\'\\nsuffered by the Allies and as a consequence they were forced to pay war reparations\\nto the victors.\\nOther Treaties\\nThe Treaty of Neuilly, signed with Bulgaria\\nThe small Balkan country suffered several territorial losses, in the benefit of\\nRomania, Greece and a brand-new country: Yugoslavia.\\nThe Treaty of Sevres (1920) signed with Turkey\\nThe Treaty of Sevres was extremely hard and led to the Turkish national rebellion,\\nwhich was led by Kemal Ataturk. This also led to the war against Greece, which\\noccupied large areas of Anatolia.\\nHowever, the war also brought other important social and ideological changes\\n5/6\\nThe\\n U.S.,\\n which had won the war but had not experienced the conflict on its territory,\\nbecame a first world power.\\nThe mass mobilization of men led to the incorporation of women into the workforce,\\nwhich was a major step forward for women\\'s rights.\\nThe triumph of the Soviet Revolution (Russian Revolution) and the social crisis that\\nfollowed the\\n war encouraged workers\\n in many countries to protest, creating a\\npre-revolutionary climate.\\nThe extreme nationalism experienced during the war, coupled with fear of a\\nCommunist revolution, encouraged the middle-class populations of some countries\\nto move to the extreme right. This created a hotbed of fascist movements.\\nCreation of the League of Nations:\\n The League of Nations was an international\\ndiplomatic group developed after World War I as a way to solve disputes between\\ncountries before they erupted into open warfare. A precursor to the United Nations,\\nthe League achieved some victories but had a mixed record of success.\\nIndia and WWI\\nIndia being a former British colony played a vital role in helping Britain and its allies\\nwin over Germany and allies, a role that is often overlooked.\\nBeing a British colony, the Indian Army contributed a large number of soldiers to the\\nEuropean, Mediterranean and the Middle East conflicts of war in World War I.\\nThe Indian Army fought against the German Empire in East Africa and also on the\\nWestern Front.\\nThey served in places as diverse as France and Belgium, Mesopotamia, Egypt,\\nGallipoli, Palestine and Sinai.\\nMore than 70 thousand of the Indian soldiers who served British in World War I lost\\ntheir lives.

Territorial clauses:\\ne France regained Alsace and Lorraine\\n¢ Eupen and Malmedy passed into the hands of Belgium\\ne Eastern territories were annexed by Poland which caused East Prussia to become territorially isolated.\\n¢ Danzig and Memel, former Baltic German cities were declared free cities\\n¢ Denmark annexed northern Schleswig-Holstein\\n© Germany lost all of its colonies and the victors annexed them\\nMilitary clauses:\\n¢ Drastic limitation of the German navy.\\n¢ Dramatic reduction of the Army (only 100,000 troops, prohibition of having tanks, aircraft and heavy artillery).\\n¢ Demilitarization of the Rhineland region.\\nWar Reparations:\\nThe treaty declared Germany and its allies responsible for all ‘loss and damage\\' suffered by the Allies and as a consequence they were forced to pay war reparations to the victors.\\nOther Treaties The Treaty of Neuilly, signed with Bulgaria\\nThe small Balkan country suffered several territorial losses, in the benefit of Romania, Greece and a brand-new country: Yugoslavia.\\nThe Treaty of Sevres (1920) signed with Turkey\\nThe Treaty of Sevres was extremely hard and led to the Turkish national rebellion, which was led by Kemal Ataturk. This also led to the war against Greece, which occupied large areas of Anatolia.\\nHowever, the war also brought other important social and ideological changes\\n5/6\\n¢ The U.S., which had won the war but had not experienced the conflict on its territory, became a first world power.\\ne The mass mobilization of men led to the incorporation of women into the workforce, which was a major step forward for women\\'s rights.\\n¢ The triumph of the Soviet Revolution (Russian Revolution) and the social crisis that followed the war encouraged workers in many countries to protest, creating a pre-revolutionary climate.\\ne The extreme nationalism experienced during the war, coupled with fear of a Communist revolution, encouraged the middle-class populations of some countries to move to the extreme right. This created a hotbed of fascist movements.\\n¢ Creation of the League of Nations: The League of Nations was an international diplomatic group developed after World War I as a way to solve disputes between countries before they erupted into open warfare. A precursor to the United Nations, the League achieved some victories but had a mixed record of success.\\nIndia and WWI\\n¢ India being a former British colony played a vital role in helping Britain and its allies win over Germany and allies, a role that is often overlooked.\\n¢ Being a British colony, the Indian Army contributed a large number of soldiers to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle East conflicts of war in World War I.\\n¢ The Indian Army fought against the German Empire in East Africa and also on the Western Front.\\n¢ They served in places as diverse as France and Belgium, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Gallipoli, Palestine and Sinai.\\n¢ More than 70 thousand of the Indian soldiers who served British in World War I lost their lives. Sir Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army once said: \" Britain couldn\\'t have come through the wars if they hadn\\'t had the Indian Army.”\\ne As high as 100 million British Pounds was given by India to Britain to fund their war anticipating dominion status and home rule in return.\\n¢ The British raised men and money from India, as well as large supplies of food, cash, and ammunition, collected by British taxation policies. In return, the British promised to award self-rule to India at the end of the war which eventually was not delivered.\\nHowever, the “war to end all wars” turned out to be the opposite. By ensuring Germany’s economic ruin and political humiliation through the Treaty of Versatile, the post-war settlement provided fertile ground for World War II.\\n6/6'"
